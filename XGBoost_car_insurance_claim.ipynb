    "when creating our sets, we want to make sure there's no bias in the negative or positive classes. So that the sets are actually reprsentative of the customer data. To be clear, when I say the positive and negative classes I'm referring to the Target variable which in this project for the classification is the \"is_claim\" feature. The positive class is that the customer has made a claim and the negative class that they haven't made a claim. Since we have a feature that describes a claim value of customers that have claimed we can use this to do something called stratified sampling. This will avoid bias in the test set.  \n",
